# 🔥 Fire Incident Mini-Portal

A full-stack web application for managing fire incident reports with enterprise-grade security, performance optimizations, and comprehensive testing.

## 🚀 What to Expect (Quick Highlights)

### 🔒 **Security-First Architecture**

- **Helmet**: CSP/HSTS headers, XSS protection, content type sniffing prevention
- **CORS**: Strict allow-list configuration with credentials support
- **HPP**: HTTP Parameter Pollution protection
- **Authentication**: Bearer token validation with comprehensive logging
- **Rate Limiting**: Separate limiters for general API (200/15min) and auth endpoints (5/15min)

### 🏗️ **Clean Architecture**

- **Frontend**: Next.js 14 (App Router) + React 18 + TypeScript
- **BFF Layer**: Next.js API routes as Backend for Frontend
- **Backend**: Express.js with clear service/middleware/validation separation
- **Data Layer**: In-memory store + JSON file persistence (survives restarts)

## 🚀 Quick Start

### **Environment Setup (backend folder)**

Create `backend/.env`:

```bash
API_TOKEN=fire-incident-secret-2024
ALLOWED_ORIGINS=http://localhost:3000,http://127.0.0.1:3000
LOG_LEVEL=info
```

---

### **Local Development**

##### Option A — manual

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install
cd frontend && npm install
cd ../backend && npm install

# Start development servers
npm run dev

```

##### Option B — one-command

```bash
npm run setup:dev
```

Note: `npm run setup:dev` is implemented with a small Node-based helper (`scripts/setup-and-run.js`) and is cross-platform — it works on Windows, macOS, and Linux shells. On Windows you can still use the PowerShell helper directly with:

To install dependencies without starting the dev servers, pass the `--no-start` flag through npm:

```bash
npm run setup:dev -- --no-start
# or
node ./scripts/setup-and-run.js --no-start
```

**Access Points:**

## 🔧 API Endpoints

### **Public Endpoints**

- `GET /api/incidents` - List all incidents (paginated, latest first)
- `GET /health` - Application health status and metrics
- `GET /api-docs` - Interactive Swagger/OpenAPI documentation

### **Authenticated Endpoints** (Requires Bearer Token)

- `POST /api/incidents` - Create new incident with file upload
- `PUT /api/incidents/:id` - Update existing incident
- `DELETE /api/incidents/:id` - Delete incident and associated files

---

## 🧪 Testing & Quality

### **Test Coverage**

- **Frontend**: Comprehensive component and integration tests to ensure reliable UI behavior
- **Backend**: End-to-end and security tests validating core APIs and authentication flows
- **Coverage**: 100% of critical paths tested

### **Quality Gates**

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test:all


# Lint and format check
npm run validate

# Pre-commit validation
npm run format:check && npm run lint && npm run test:all
```

### **Git Workflow**

- **Conventional Commits**: Enforced commit message standards
- **Pre-commit Hooks**: Automatic code quality checks
- **Pre-push Validation**: Full test suite execution

## 🐳 Docker Configuration

### **Development Environment**

```bash
# Start development with hot reload
docker compose up -d

# View logs
docker compose logs -f

# Stop services
docker compose down
```

## ⚖️ Tradeoffs & Assumptions

**Chosen for Simplicity:**

- JSON file storage instead of database (acceptable for demo/small scale)
- In-memory primary storage for fast reads (assumes single server instance)
- Bearer token auth instead of JWT/OAuth (simpler for demo purposes)

**Assumptions:**

- File storage on local filesystem (no cloud storage integration)
- Single time zone operation (no multi-timezone support)
- Manual incident reporting (no AI automated integration)
- Basic user roles (no complex permission hierarchies)
- Development/staging environment similar to production
- Image files under 10MB (no large video/document support)
- Basic reporting needs (no complex analytics required)

---

## 🤖 **AI Assistance**

- I used AI as a force multiplier to accelerate ~60–70% of the project—scaffolding the Express backend with security middleware, generating Zod validation schemas, wiring Next.js routes, drafting test suites, and producing Dockerfiles and Swagger docs.

- I thoroughly tested everything to ensure it worked end-to-end and made targeted manual adjustments where AI output had gaps or errors. This freed me to focus on the “last mile”: hardening security (rate limits, upload constraints, auth logging), trimming performance bottlenecks, validating 100% of critical paths, and refining DX with Husky hooks and clear docs.

- Result: AI handled the boilerplate, while I directed and refined architecture, security, performance, and operability to enterprise standards—backed by rigorous testing and hands-on fixes.
